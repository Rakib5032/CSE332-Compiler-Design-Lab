This is a compiler Design lab project. In this project, we try to build a mini compiler for the C language. This is an interpreter-type compiler. This compiler reads the whole C program from first to last and calls a function based on the action. This is a basic type of compiler. This complier has features like scanf, printf. This compiler supports three data types: int, char, and char[] (array of char). Basic arithmetic operations like +, -, *, and / can be done using the compiler. There is a basic function for custom function declaration. This is all about the project.
